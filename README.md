# COLING 2018 Tutorial on Multilingual FrameNet: Automatic semantic role labeling for FrameNet

A [tutorial](https://framenet.icsi.berkeley.edu/fndrupal/node/5552/) at [COLING 2018](https://coling2018.org/) taught by Collin Baker, Michael J. Ellsworth, Miriam R. L. Petruck and Swabha Swayamdipta. This repository contains [slides for automatic semantic role labeling for FrameNet](https://github.com/Noahs-ARK/coling18tutorial/blob/master/Slides-Swabha.pdf).

## Abstract

The [FrameNet Project](http://framenet.icsi.berkeley.edu) at the International Computer Science Institute has built a lexical database for contemporary English, defining over 1,220 semantic frames containing more than 13,600 lexical units (word senses), whose valence descriptions are documented by more than 202,000 manually annotated examples. Natural Language Processing researchers and developers have shown that Frame Semantic representations are useful in applications such as question answering, text-to-scene systems, spoken dialog systems, and social network extraction.

Separate research projects have developed Frame Semantic lexical databases for approximately a [dozen more languages](https://framenet.icsi.berkeley.edu/fndrupal/framenets_in_other_languages) (including Brazilian Portuguese, Chinese, Hebrew, Korean, and Swedish) based in varying degrees on the original FrameNet database structure (Baker et al. 2003), frame descriptions, etc., and on FrameNet methodology and annotation practices (Ruppenhofer et al. 2016).

The goals of the Multilingual FrameNet Project (NSF Award #1629989) are: 
1. to align the databases of the different FrameNets at the level of frames and that of words (technically, lexical units, i.e., a single sense of a word in a frame); and 
2. to investigate the extent to which the semantic frames of the English FrameNet database might be construed as cross-culturally and cross-linguistically “the same” and to determine the underlying linguistic and cultural differences when they differ. 
Multilingual FrameNet has also begun a parallel annotation task, which requires addressing a range of questions involving representation, cross-lingual framing differences, metonymy, and metaphor, as well as the interaction of frames and constructions (Fillmore 1988, 2013).

Participants in this tutorial will learn about:

1. FrameNet, its methodology, and practices
2. Cross-linguistic similarities and differences among the languages
3. Principles of multilingual alignment and the challenges involved
4. Issues of Representation in frame vs. constructional analyses
5. Potential Applications of a multilingual FrameNet database
